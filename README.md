# Alpha
[Integration Information Theory](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory) of Tononi contends that calculation of integrated information can give an account of consciousness. One "weakness" of IIT is the massive computation needed for the integration of information. Alpha born as an alternative to this calculation based on the thesis of natural computationalism, and Principle of Computational Equivalence, that roughly contends that small or simple rules can reproduce complex behaviors. Alpha is a kind of reduction of behaviors into small rules based on biology studies that accelerate the integration information calculus
